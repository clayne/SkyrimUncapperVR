# SkyrimUncapperVR
Fork of Kassent's Skyrim Uncapper for SE edition to work in VR.

Download dll from the DLL folder in the github project to use

Installation:

1) You need a DLL loader. I use xSHADOWMANx's DLL Loader: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3619

2) If using above place the SkyrimUncapper.dll in Data\Plugins\Sumwunn

3) Run the game the first time to generate the ini file in the same directory the dll is in. YOu can then tweak it how you want.

Even though it will load and run without running SKSEVR I would recommend running with the sksevr_loader.exe to launch the game.
